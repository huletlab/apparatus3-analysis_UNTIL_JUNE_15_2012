<div class="textblock"><p>Changes for <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a> 2.1 release Nov 2008</p>
<ul>
<li>Modified several FITS constructors and FITS::open function to allow proper handling of CFITSIO <b>extended filename syntax</b>.</li>
<li>Extended filename syntax example added to cookbook.</li>
<li>Fix made to FITS::read function for case of missing EXTVER keyword when searching for HDU with extver &gt; 1.</li>
<li>Removed inclusion of the internal-only CFITSIO fitsio2.h file from Column.cxx. LONGLONG limits definitions are now found in fitsio.h.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes for <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a> 2.0 release Feb 2008 Enhancements to <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Checksum Capability:</b> 4 checksum related functions have been added to the HDU class, which now allows users to set and verify checksums directly from inside <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a>.</li>
<li><b>Capturing Error Messages:</b> The FitsException base class now stores its output error message, and it can be retrieved from any of the exception subclass objects with a call to the new FitsException::message() function.</li>
<li><b>Improved Keyword Handling:</b> New functions copyAllKeys, keywordCategories, and a second addKey function have been added to the HDU class. The Keyword class now offers a public setValue function to modify an existing keyword. Also the class member documentation for keyword related functions has been upgraded and expanded.</li>
<li><b>Image Scaling:</b> In the HDU class (for instances of its PHDU and image ExtHDU subclasses), scale and zero set functions can now write BSCALE and BZERO keywords to the file. A new suppressScaling function has been added to temporarily turn off scaling. The ImageExt&lt;T&gt; class has also been added to the documentation.</li>
<li><b>Miscellaneous New Functions:</b>Table::getRowsize() (submitted by Patrik Jonsson), Fits::fitsPointer(), Column::parent().</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>FITS constructor in Write mode caused a segmentation fault when used on read-only files. (Reported by Gerard Zins)</li>
<li>Column write functions were not turning off NULL checking even when the nulval pointer was set to 0. (Reported by Gerard Zins)</li>
<li>For the FITS constructor which takes an existing FITS object as an argument, when given the filename of an existing file (and without the '!' specifier), it places a new primary HDU in the first extension. It shouldn't allow a write operation at all in this case. (Reported by Andy Beardmore)</li>
<li>Some additional #include statements are needed for compilation on a test version of g++4.3 (Reported by Aurelien Jarno)</li>
</ul>
<p>Backwards Compatibility Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The following documented public access member functions have now been removed or made protected/private. As these functions were either never fully implemented or could not successfully be used from external code, it is hoped that these removals will not break any pre-existing code: FITS::clone, HDU::setKeyWord, the HDU::bitpix set function, the Keyword class constructors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes for <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a> 1.8 release 10/07.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes made to bugs in Column write and writeArrays functions which were preventing the writing of variable-width columns. Also now allows writing to fixed-width columns with arrays that are shorter than the fixed width.</li>
<li>The HDU::readAllKeys() function will no longer throw if it is unable to read a particular keyword. Instead it will skip it and move to the next keyword. This was done primarily to prevent it from tripping on undefined keywords.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes for <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a> 1.7 release 6/07. Fixes for the following bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FITS::copy function merely wrote the copied HDU to the file, but did not allow it to be accessed for further modifications within <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a>.</li>
<li>When reading compressed images, <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a> should use the ZBITPIX and ZNAXIS keywords rather than BITPIX and NAXIS. (Fix is based on a patch submitted by Patrik Jonsson.)</li>
<li>The BSCALE keyword was being ignored if the BZERO keyword didn't also exist.</li>
<li>Cases of out-of-scope usage of std::string's c_str() pointers, could potentially cause crash. (Fix submitted by Jeremy Sanders.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes for <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a> 1.6 release 11/06</p>
<ul>
<li>Added capbility to write compressed images, including 6 new wrapper public functions in FITS class.</li>
<li>In FITS::addImage, corrected the logic which checks for a pre-existing image extension with the same version number.</li>
<li>CFITSIO 3.02 renamed fitsfile struct member rice_nbits to noise_nbits. Made corresponding change in copyFitsPtr function in FITSUtil.cxx. As it stands, this makes this version of <a class="el" href="namespaceCCfits.html" title="Namespace enclosing all CCfits classes and globals definitions.">CCfits</a> incompatible with earlier versions of CFITSIO</li>
<li>In <a class="el" href="FITS_8h_source.html">FITS.h</a> definition, removed both friend declarations of HDUCreator Make functions. It seems neither function needs to be a friend, and one of them is actually private. Some compilers don't allow this (report came from MS VisualC++ user).</li>
<li>Bug fix in Make function of HDUCreator.cxx. When creating a new ImageExt (and not the primary), it was only passing the version number along for float and double types. This causes problems when there is more than 1 image extension with the same name, and it needs the version number to distinguish them.</li>
<li>A couple of bug fixes to the first/last/stride version of PHDU read image subset. It was not passing the proper parameters to fits_read_subset, and was not always correctly resizing the internal m_image array. </li>
</ul>
